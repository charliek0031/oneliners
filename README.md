# oneliners
Just a bunch of oneliners to make my life in Linux world simplerder.

There are some oneliners that will appear here aimed at pentesting:

# I do not condone hacking of others!!!

But I do condone learning about security and testing it on yourself!
For me personally it has opened a world of valuable information.
Having people living near me having hacked me made me open my eyes that just a good password isn't enough.

Some oneliners that will be placed here are solely for my own sake as an aid in remembering stuff.
But if I can help others then I am happy already.

Using this stuff is YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY!
